                    <li><b>2020 JAN PERSONAL PROJECT</b> I have been learning online classes for coding and web
                        designing for more than one year. I have managed to code a simple E-commerce website which in
                        future will help entrepreneurs to sell their products worldwide. I’m convinced I have a good
                        understanding of front-end web development like HTML, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js and CSS.</li>

                        and later I got employed. It increased my general cognitive skills in the field of sales and
                        entrepreneur. Additionally, I was also helping to distribute goods such as clothes and new
                        imported shoes to other shops and customers far and within the town.</li>
